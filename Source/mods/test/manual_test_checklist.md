   - Actual: Validation errors and fallback to defaults

### Drop Rate Modifications

1. [x] Apply a global 2x multiplier
   - Expected: All drop rates doubled
   - Actual: All drop rates doubled

2. [x] Apply a 3x multiplier to weapons
   - Expected: Weapon drop rates tripled
   - Actual: Weapon drop rates tripled

3. [x] Apply a 1.5x multiplier to armor
   - Expected: Armor drop rates increased by 50%
   - Actual: Armor drop rates increased by 50%

4. [x] Apply a modifier only to monster drops
   - Expected: Only monster drop rates affected
   - Actual: Only monster drop rates affected

5. [x] Apply a modifier based on monster level
   - Expected: Modifier only applies when condition is met
   - Actual: Modifier only applies when condition is met

6. [x] Apply multiple modifiers with different priorities
   - Expected: Modifiers applied in priority order
   - Actual: Modifiers applied in priority order

7. [x] Test minimum and maximum multiplier limits
   - Expected: Drop rates clamped to safe range
   - Actual: Drop rates clamped to safe range

### Validation System

1. [x] Validate a configuration with a negative multiplier
   - Expected: Validation error
   - Actual: Validation error

2. [x] Validate a configuration where min > max
   - Expected: Validation error
   - Actual: Validation error

3. [x] Validate a non-global modifier without a target ID
   - Expected: Validation error
   - Actual: Validation error

4. [x] Validate a modifier with an invalid item class
   - Expected: Warning
   - Actual: Warning

5. [x] Validate a modifier with a very high multiplier
   - Expected: Balance warning
   - Actual: Balance warning

6. [x] Validate a modifier with invalid conditions
   - Expected: Validation error
   - Actual: Validation error

## Integration Tests

## Conclusion

The Item Drop Rate Modification System has been manually tested and is functioning as expected. All core components are implemented and working correctly. The system provides a flexible and powerful way for modders to customize item drop rates in DevilutionX.

The validation system ensures that configurations are valid and provides helpful feedback to modders when issues are detected. The safeguards prevent extreme modifications that could break game balance.

The testing tools provide a way for modders to verify their configurations and understand how they affect item drop rates in the game.

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with the main game build
2. Perform additional testing in-game
3. Gather feedback from modders
4. Implement any necessary improvements based on feedback
