# DevilutionX Crash and Visual Artifacts Fix PRD

## Project Overview
This project aims to fix a critical crash in DevilutionX related to the new scaling mechanisms and address visual artifacts appearing on screen. The crash occurs in the StaticVector implementation with std::pair<unsigned char, unsigned char> and manifests as an access violation in memset_repstos.

## Goals
- Fix the crash occurring in the StaticVector implementation
- Address visual artifacts appearing on screen
- Ensure compatibility with the new scaling mechanisms
- Maintain performance and stability

## Technical Details
- Crash occurs at: vcruntime140.dll!memset_repstos() Line 43
- Related to: devilution::StaticVector<struct std::pair<unsigned char,unsigned char>,127>::StaticVector
- Access violation writing location 0x000000F922D10000
- Likely related to the monster scaling and difficulty wave systems

## Core Features to Fix

### Crash in StaticVector Implementation
- Investigate memory corruption in StaticVector initialization
- Fix potential buffer overflow or memory alignment issues
- Address possible race conditions in the rendering code
- Ensure proper initialization of std::pair<unsigned char, unsigned char> elements

### Visual Artifacts
- Identify the source of visual artifacts on screen
- Fix rendering issues related to the scaling mechanisms
- Ensure proper cleanup of rendering resources
- Address potential issues with the OutlineRowSolidRuns implementation

### Scaling Mechanism Compatibility
- Ensure monster scaling debug utilities work correctly
- Fix any issues with the difficulty wave implementation
- Address potential issues with the dynamic difficulty system
- Ensure proper synchronization between systems

## Success Criteria
- No crashes when using the scaling mechanisms
- No visual artifacts appear on screen
- All systems function correctly together
- Performance remains optimal

## Timeline
The project will be implemented in phases:
1. Investigation and Analysis - Identify the root causes of the issues
2. Implementation of Fixes - Address the identified issues
3. Testing and Validation - Ensure the fixes work correctly
4. Documentation - Update documentation to reflect changes

Priority will be given to fixing the crash before addressing visual artifacts.
