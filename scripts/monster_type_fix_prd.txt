# Monster Type 138 Crash Fix PRD

## Overview
DevilutionX is experiencing a crash with the error message "ERROR: AddMonsterType: Invalid monster type: 138" followed by "Invalid monster type". This issue needs to be fixed to prevent the game from crashing when encountering monster type 138.

## Problem Statement
The game crashes when attempting to add a monster with type ID 138. The code in `AddMonsterType` function validates monster types and rejects any that are outside the valid range (0 to MonstersData.size()-1). However, there's a comment in the `IsGolem` function suggesting that both monster types 138 and 139 should be handled as special cases for Golems, but the implementation only handles MT_GOLEM (259) and type 139.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Fix the crash when the game encounters monster type 138
2. Ensure proper handling of monster type 138 as a Golem type
3. Maintain compatibility with existing game mechanics
4. Add proper validation and error handling for monster types
5. Add unit tests to verify the fix works correctly

### Technical Requirements
1. Update the `IsGolem` function to properly handle monster type 138
2. Modify the `AddMonsterType` function to correctly process monster type 138
3. Add appropriate logging for debugging purposes
4. Ensure no regressions in existing functionality
5. Implement unit tests to validate the fix

## Success Criteria
1. The game no longer crashes when encountering monster type 138
2. All unit tests pass
3. No new bugs or regressions are introduced
4. The fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue

## Implementation Approach
1. Create unit tests to reproduce the issue
2. Fix the `IsGolem` function to properly handle monster type 138
3. Update the `AddMonsterType` function as needed
4. Verify the fix with unit tests
5. Test the fix in the actual game environment
