      "taskTitle": "Set up development environment with both build configurations",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of setting up a development environment for DevilutionX with both Release and RelWithDebInfo configurations, including repository cloning, dependency installation, CMake configuration, and build verification steps.",
      "reasoning": "This is a moderately complex setup task with clear sequential steps already outlined. The complexity comes from potential environment-specific issues and dependency management, but the task has well-defined steps and clear success criteria."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Analyze compilation errors in clx_render.cpp",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create detailed subtasks for analyzing compilation errors in clx_render.cpp, including error categorization, identifying problematic template code sections, dependency mapping between affected functions, and documenting findings with code snippets.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires deep technical analysis of template-related compilation errors, which can be complex and interdependent. Understanding template instantiation issues requires expertise in C++ templates and compiler behavior, making this a high-complexity diagnostic task."

    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Investigate differences between RelWithDebInfo and Release builds",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps needed to thoroughly compare RelWithDebInfo and Release build configurations, including compiler flag analysis, preprocessor definition comparison, template instantiation differences, and optimization level impacts.",
      "reasoning": "This is a highly complex investigation requiring deep knowledge of build systems, compiler behavior, and C++ template instantiation. The task involves understanding subtle interactions between optimization levels, debug information, and template resolution across different build configurations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Fix template parameter deduction issues",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create detailed subtasks for fixing template parameter deduction issues in clx_render.cpp, including addressing undeclared identifiers, fixing deduction failures, resolving template specialization conflicts, and implementing incremental testing of each fix.",
      "reasoning": "This is a very complex implementation task requiring expert-level C++ template knowledge. Fixing template deduction issues often involves understanding complex type traits, SFINAE, and compiler-specific behaviors. The incremental testing approach adds further complexity to ensure changes don't break other functionality."

    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Ensure consistent interfaces between blit function types",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of standardizing interfaces between different blit function types in clx_render.cpp, including interface review, inconsistency identification, signature standardization, and backward compatibility preservation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires careful refactoring of function interfaces while maintaining backward compatibility. The complexity comes from ensuring consistent template parameter usage across multiple function types and understanding the implicit conversions that might work differently between build configurations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Address preprocessor directive issues",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps needed to identify and fix preprocessor directive issues in clx_render.cpp that might cause different behavior between build configurations, including macro expansion analysis and refactoring problematic preprocessor-based code.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves understanding how preprocessor directives interact with template code across different build configurations. While complex, it's more focused than some of the other tasks, dealing specifically with preprocessor-related issues that affect compilation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement comprehensive fixes and test RelWithDebInfo build",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create detailed subtasks for implementing all necessary fixes to make the RelWithDebInfo build compile successfully, including integration of previous fixes, addressing remaining errors, and ensuring code quality and standards compliance.",
      "reasoning": "This integration task requires bringing together multiple complex fixes while ensuring they work together harmoniously. The complexity comes from potential interactions between different fixes and the need to maintain code quality while making significant changes to template code."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Verify fixes and ensure no regressions",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the verification process for ensuring the template fixes work correctly in both build configurations, including comprehensive testing, performance comparison, and preparation of documentation and pull request.",
      "reasoning": "This verification task requires thorough testing across multiple build configurations. The complexity comes from ensuring no regressions in functionality or performance while verifying that all compilation issues have been resolved in both configurations."
