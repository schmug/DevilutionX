# DevilutionX Dynamic Difficulty System PRD

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance DevilutionX with a dynamic difficulty system based on player gear level. The system will automatically adjust monster difficulty based on the player's equipment quality, creating a more balanced and engaging gameplay experience that adapts to the player's progression.

## Goals
- Create a more engaging and balanced gameplay experience
- Provide appropriate challenge regardless of player gear level
- Allow players to feel powerful after significant gear upgrades
- Maintain the core gameplay feel while adding depth

# Core Features

## Dynamic Difficulty System
- Calculate player "Gear Level" based on equipment quality and character level
- Adjust monster difficulty based on the calculated Gear Level
- Implement smooth transitions between difficulty levels
- Add visual indicators for current difficulty level on the minimap
- Create wave effects in difficulty to provide varied gameplay

## Technical Requirements
- Implement gear scoring system that evaluates item quality, type, and affixes
- Create monster stat scaling that preserves monster behavior while adjusting difficulty
- Add UI elements to display gear level and current difficulty
- Implement smoothing algorithms for difficulty transitions
- Ensure compatibility with multiplayer by synchronizing difficulty calculations
- Maintain save game compatibility

## Success Criteria
- Players experience appropriate challenge regardless of gear level
- Difficulty transitions feel smooth and natural
- Players can feel temporarily overpowered after significant gear upgrades
- Visual indicators clearly communicate current difficulty level
- System maintains game balance without requiring manual adjustments

## Timeline
The project will be implemented in phases:

1. Gear Level Calculation - Implement the core system for evaluating player equipment
2. Monster Difficulty Adjustment - Create scaling for monster stats based on gear level
3. UI Integration - Add visual indicators for gear level and difficulty
4. Smoothing and Wave Effects - Implement algorithms for natural difficulty transitions

Priority will be given to creating a functional core system before adding refinements.
